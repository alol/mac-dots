MacDots: Dotfiles for your Mac
==============================

Dotfiles for Z-Shell on a Mac. Simples.

Preparation
-----------
Although you will be prompted to overwrite any existing dotfiles during instalation, it's still a good idea to backup any of your existing dotfiles should you wish to undo anything.

    cp ~/.zshrc ~/Desktop

Do the same for any other files you want to backup.

To keep any custom or personal bash settings, see the `Customization` section below.

Prerequisites
-------------
For the installation script to work, you must have the following installed:

    ruby
    rake gem
    oh-my-zsh

Installation
------------
    cd ~
    git clone git://github.com/edjames/mac-dots ~/.mac-dots
    cd ~/.mac-dots
    ./script/bootstrap

You will be prompted before any existing files are overwritten. Symlinks are created for each dotfile in this project.

Updating
--------
    upgrade_macdots

Customization
-------------
It is possible to customize your zsh environment even further by putting things in one of the following two files:

    ${HOME}/.before-mac-dots
    ${HOME}/.after-mac-dots

As their respective names indicate, these files are executed **before** and **after** the actual `dotfiles` files are executed.

These two files are **not** under git control, so are truly personal.

Tip:

To make updates easier, put the following environment variables into your
.before-mac-dots file so that you don't have to type them out during an update:

export GIT_NAME="<your name>"
export GIT_EMAIL="<your email>"
